Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ``` contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"events\":{\"Initialized(uint8)\":{\"details\":\"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"custom:oz-retyped-from\":\"bool\",\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[\":forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\"],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xc50599cfb36dcaaead4461730033324963036abe1e6307da5c8867ddcb8138b6\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://19fff0b6ec8410ca0c536743773092313f70cea2ee3f6494a139b6e95cb21e6c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTQJvsbT5htRo8uBH3k5Bro7kVKHeTV6HFyAn7YVw8635\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/Address.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x4c66187702ed8a8d2fe5fe2407ff4bc79082620c3651e1b2c534777fa123d93f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://74cadcca3e7b58a94b54f7a7ac86c874410cdb24e5b0248086923da001b90087\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVDyaM3vg5ajnD3PnRrfQH9zhEYc2NeEkvih7chVCdwne\"]}},\"version\":1}","metadata":{"compiler":{"version":"0.8.15+commit.e14f2714"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint8","name":"version","type":"uint8","indexed":false}],"type":"event","name":"Initialized","anonymous":false}],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"compilationTarget":{"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"london","libraries":{},"viaIR":true},"sources":{"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":{"keccak256":"0xc50599cfb36dcaaead4461730033324963036abe1e6307da5c8867ddcb8138b6","urls":["bzz-raw://19fff0b6ec8410ca0c536743773092313f70cea2ee3f6494a139b6e95cb21e6c","dweb:/ipfs/QmTQJvsbT5htRo8uBH3k5Bro7kVKHeTV6HFyAn7YVw8635"],"license":"MIT"},"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/Address.sol":{"keccak256":"0x4c66187702ed8a8d2fe5fe2407ff4bc79082620c3651e1b2c534777fa123d93f","urls":["bzz-raw://74cadcca3e7b58a94b54f7a7ac86c874410cdb24e5b0248086923da001b90087","dweb:/ipfs/QmVDyaM3vg5ajnD3PnRrfQH9zhEYc2NeEkvih7chVCdwne"],"license":"MIT"}},"version":1},"id":5}
